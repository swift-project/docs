swift has build-in AFV support.
If you want to disable it (e.g. because you want to use the external AFV client) you can do.

-   From the client:

![](./../../img/disableafv1.jpg){: style="width:50%"}

-   From swift launcher:

![](./../../img/disableafv2.jpg){: style="width:50%"}

-   as command line argument ``--noaudio``
