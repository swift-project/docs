The ideal choice for using P3D with *swift* is the 64bit version.
However, for P3D before V4.2 you need to use *swift's* 32bit version!
You can try the 64bit version, but most likely the driver will not connect.

You can also use the 32bit version with the newer P3D versions, but then always the legacy FSX driver will be used.

* *swift* 64bit version uses the latest P3D SimConnect API and library
* *swift* 32bit version uses the FSX SimConnect API and ``DLL``

In the mid and long term, the new SimConnect will use newer P3D API functions that are not available in legacy versions of SimConnect.
So far, the differences between the old and new API are minor, but they are steadily increasing.
As of P3D V4.2, *swift* has already been using newer functions and we are going to use even better functions available in 4.3 and later.
