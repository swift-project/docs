To follow aircraft in X-Plane you can use ''follow aircraft''

  * aircraft can be selected from the **xswiftbus** menu or from the **Aircraft** widget in *swift*GUI (select an aircraft from the list ==> right-click ==> ''Follow in simulator'')
  * to **change** your **point of view** (view direction), keep your *spacebar* pressed and move your mouse
  * to **increase/decrease** the **distance** to the plane, use ''arrowdown''/''arrowup'' on your keyboard
  * you can also **change the standard distance** for flight following.
    In *swift*GUI select the **Settings** widget ==> Simulator ==> click on the ''[...]'' icon next to **X-Plane**.
    This will open a new window where you can change the standard distance for flight following.
    The unit is in metres, 1m = 3.28ft.
    Please note that changes will only take affect after you restart X-Plane.
