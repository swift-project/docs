Let's say you want to fix/change a particular mapping.

-   locate this mapping in the mapping DB data

![](./../../img/changemapping1.jpg){: style="width:50%"}


-   here I find it by its id, but this is is just an example

![](./../../img/changemapping2.jpg){: style="width:50%"}

-   you could also find it by other filter criteria

![](./../../img/changemapping3.jpg)

-   then you mark this model and stash it, `ALT + s` also works

![](./../../img/changemapping4.jpg){: style="width:75%"}

-   changing a model requires to login
-   now it can be changed in the mapping editor under stashed models

![](./../../img/changemapping5.jpg){: style="width:50%"}

![](./../../img/changemapping6.jpg)

-   and the published

![](./../../img/changemapping7.jpg){: style="width:50%"}
