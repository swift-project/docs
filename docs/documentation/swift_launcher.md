*swift*Launcher can be used to access all components of *swift*, to update the client, *xswiftbus* and the database and to change the operational mode of the pilot client.

## Window Type
In this section you can configure whether you wish to run *swift*GUI in a **normal window** with frames or frameless.
This setting will only take effect when you start *swift*GUI through *swift*Launcher.
When you start through the standard program shortcut, this setting will not be used, unless you [add a parameter with a Command Line Argument](./../troubleshooting/command_line_arguments.md).

## Core Mode
This section is interesting for users who would like to run *swift* on a remote computer, the so called **[Distributed Mode](./distributed.md)**.
For all other users it is important to have this set to ``standalone``.
