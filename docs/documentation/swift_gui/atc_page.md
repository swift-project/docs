This page of *swift*GUI will provide you with information about **Air Traffic Controllers** that are **active in the area where you are online**.

You can choose from 2 tabs:

* **ATC List**
* **ATC tree view** (categorized ATC stations)

## General List
The first tab will present you with a **general list of ATC stations** that is **sorted by distance** (ascending) between your own position and the primary centers of visibility of air traffic controllers.

### In Range
You can filter this list by ``in range`` stations (default setting).
The ``ATC stations`` **tab** displays the number of total and filtered stations (in the below screenshot "4 of 10").

### All Stations
When you select ``all``, you will also see other stations that are **in your greater area**, but they may be outside of your communication range.

## ATC Tree

The **ATC Tree** tab groups ATC stations into categories (ATIS, DEL, GND, TWR, APP, CTR, FSS).
This may be more convenient to some users as it improves the overview of who's online.

## Controller and ATIS Information
By **clicking on** any of the list's **ATC and ATIS stations** you can retrieve the text information that they are providing.

* the text will be shown in the **information box below the list**
* you can **adjust the vertical extent** of the information box by dragging the **blue divider up and down**

## METAR Information
It is possible to **request METAR information** by typing an ICAO code in the small field above the information box and then clicking on the ``METAR-button``

## Context Menu
When selecting and right-clicking any station on any of these lists, you will be able to open a **Context Menu** with additional functions.

You can
* **tune ATC-frequencies** directly in your flight simulator
* **show the (public) text message tab** on the [Text/Chat page](./text_chat_page.md) of the selected ATC
