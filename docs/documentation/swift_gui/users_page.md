The Users Widget will provide you with two different kinds of lists of other users in your vicinity.

One tab is labelled ``Users`` and shows some general information about other people around your position:

The second tab is called ``Clients`` and has some more information, e.g. voice capability

![](./../../img/manual_swiftgui_users_listclients.jpg){: style="width:70%"}

The last tab, ``Matchin log``, is identical to the one that you can also find in the **Models Widget**. [More information](./models/index.md#matching-log)
