!!! warning "SSO Login TEMPORARILY **NOT** POSSIBLE"

    SSO function is broken on our website!
    If you want to add/map aircraft or make other change requests, please contact us on our Discord server!


## Registering with swift Datastore
In order to submit [Change Requests(CR)](./change_requests.md) for airlines, aircraft types and airline liveries you need to be registered with *swift* Datastore.

* <del>for **members of** this is rather simple: just use **VATSIM's Single Sign On (SSO)** to connect *swift* Datastore to your VATSIM account.
  Once you have successfully logged in through VATSIM SSO, you are registered and you will be able to submit Change Requests</del>
* if you are **not** a member of VATSIM, then please [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/R7Atd9A) and request an account with one of our administrators


**Suggestion**: after logging in to *swift* Datastore you can amend your account with your e-mail address and with a custom password for *swift* Datastore operations

![](./../../img/datastore_changeyourdata.jpg)

* **Username:** keep the suggested name, it should be the same as your registered name at VATSIM
* **Email:** choose an e-mail address that you will always be able to access, as we will send password reset instructions and program notifications to this one
* **DB password:** the password that you define here can be used in *swift*GUI, *swift*DATA and on the website of *swift* Datastore to login to the Datastore, in case that you prefer this over using your VATSIM network password.

!!! tip

    To login to *swift* Datastore you can use your VATSIM ID number instead of your username.
