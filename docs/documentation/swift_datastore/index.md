# swift Datastore

The *swift* **Datastore** is our central database.
Essentially it contains all ICAO data for airlines and aircraft types, liveries, aircraft&model distributors, model data, aircraft mapping information, admin-functions to work with user change requests and more.


You can reach it with [this link](https://datastore.swift-project.org/page/).
