For FS9, the most widely used model set is **World of AI (WoAI)**.

You can find a **World of AI Installer App** at the VATSIM forums, just **[follow this link](https://forums.vatsim.net/topic/17296-world-of-ai-package-downloader/)**.

*swift* and FS9 can use **fully flyable aircraft** to render other online pilots, they will work nicely.

Install all AI aircraft into the ``\aircraft\`` directory of your copy of Flight Simulator 2004 / FS9.
