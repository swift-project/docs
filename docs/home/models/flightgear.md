You do not need to download additional models for Flightgear.
You can use the existing models from ``$FGROOT\AI\Aircraft\`` any other folder which contains user-flyable airplanes.

To use them, add ``$FGROOT\AI\Aircraft\`` and other aircraft folders to your **[model directories](./../install/configure_fg.md#setup-of-each-individual-simulator)** through *swift* **Config Wizard** or *swift***Data** (**Mapping Tool**).
