# X-Plane

At the time of creating this page, the most popular **CSL (Common Shape Library)** model distributors for X-Plane 11 are **BlueBell (BB)**  and  **X-CSL**.

!!! note

    **Distributor** is the term that *swift* uses to define a person or a company that produces and/or provides aircraft models, flyable or not.
    "BlueBell" is a distributor, just like "FlightFactor" and "PMDG".

## Recommended Installation Practices
Before you proceed with downloading and installing CSL models for the first time, read this paragraph as it contains some vital information!

!!! important

    CSL models have to be placed somewhere **inside** the program path of X-Plane 11.
    **External linking of CSL models is **not** possible.**
    Otherwise X-Plane will not be able to use them to display the aircraft of other online-pilots near you.

As good practice it has been established that the folder ``Custom Data`` is used to install CSL models in.
Since many users want to use CSL sets from more than one distributor, a parent-folder called "CSL" will be created in there and the CSL-sets are placed in this new path subsequently.

For example, with BlueBell and X-CSL model sets installed, your file path structure should look like this:

* ``yourdrive:\X-Plane 11\Custom Data\CSL\BB``
* ``yourdrive:\X-Plane 11\Custom Data\CSL\X-CSL``

Should you wish to add more CSL sets, just create new subfolders in ``Custom Data\CSL\``, e.g.

* ``Other`` => ``Custom Data\CSL\**Other**``
* ``General Aviation`` => ``Custom Data\CSL\**General Aviation**``

or whatever you think fits.


## Installation of CSL model sets
* **BlueBell** [proceed to subpage](./bluebell.md)
* **X-CSL** [proceed to subpage](./xcsl.md)
* **Miscellaneous** [aircraft download links](./index.md#miscellaneous)

!!! important

    With X-Plane 11.50 and newer, **only OBJ8-models can be used**.
    OBJ7 and older will **not** work and will produce error messages.
    Say goodbye to OBJ7 CSL models!

## Miscellaneous
Whenever you update any model from the list here, you will have to re-create your Active Model Set, otherwise *swift* won't know about and won't be able to use your new models.
You can either do this in *swift* **Config Wizard** by [creating your "first model set"](./../../install/configure_xp.md#first-model-set-wizard) or by starting *swift's* **Mapping Tool** (*swift*Data app).
Visit the **section about the Mapping Tool** and check out our **[YouTube Video Tutorial: Working with the Mapping Tool](https://youtu.be/hqOsjmV7wus)** :simple-youtube:
