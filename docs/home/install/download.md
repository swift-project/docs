## Windows: what version of swift do I have to use?

**Windows users only:** whether you need to install the **32bit or 64bit** version of *swift* does **not** depend on your operating system, but on the flight simulator platform that you intend to use it with!

Please consult this table to determine what version of *swift* you need to download and install:


| Flight Simulator Platform | swift 32bit                        | swift 64bit                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| FS2004 - FS9              | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:x:<center>                |
| FSX                       | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:x:<center>                |
| MSFS - FS2020             | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> |
| P3D v1-v3                 | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:x:<center>                |
| P3D v4 and later          | <center>:x:<center>                | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> |
| X-Plane 11                | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> |
| Flightgear                | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> | <center>:white_check_mark:<center> |

**X-Plane Users**:

- up to and including **X-Plane 11.41**, use *swift* **0.9.4**
- from **X-Plane version 11.50** onwards you must use *swift* **0.9.5 and newer**

**MSFS FS2020 Users**:

- although Microsoft's new Flight Simulator is a 64bit application, its module "Simconnect" is a 32bit program and thus only the 32bit versions of *swift* **0.9.6+** will work.
