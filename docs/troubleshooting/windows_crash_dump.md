If you encounter swift hanging and NOT responding anymore you could create a crashdump and make this available for the swift team.

## Crash dump files

* Here it is described how to do that, easy and simple: "look for task manager"
    * <https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/758511>
    * <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/debugger/2009/12/30/what-is-a-dump-and-how-do-i-create-one/>

- as the dmp file is quite big please zip it (rar it, whatever) and
    upload it to your shared drive (like Google drive, ...) and send us
    the link

- Let us know you have that files: <https://discord.gg/R7Atd9A>
    (DISCORD, 3rd party)

Hints
=====

Hanging can have multiple reasons

-   swift has opened a model window but you do not see this window
    because it has opened up on a different screen.
