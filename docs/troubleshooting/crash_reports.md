swift can send crash reports to our server, so we can check what is going wrong.
However, this is also a privacy issue, as we need to send detailed information.

A crash report includes

- detailed information about your swift installation and runtime environment
- your IP address
- information about your computer hardware

We will store the information until we have resolved the issue and then delete it.
You can help us a lot if you enable crash reports, but if you have privacy concerns just disable it.
