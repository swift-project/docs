- In general all models in the model set should have a DB entry, only those have correct data assigned

- The default matching settings even ignore the models without DB entries

However, there can be reasons where it make sense to include non DB models.
If you write your own matching script, then you might want to use raw models (see [matching script](./../model_matching/matching_script.md)) .

To use models without DB data, see [matching settings](./../../documentation/swift_gui/settings_page.md#matching).
