## Joystick

We have had cases where loading joystick data caused *swift* to crash.
Reason unknown so far.
Solution: Try to unplug the joystick and see if it works now

## Window locations

Changes in your UI setup (new graphics card) can cause the stored windows sizes etc. being invalid.
Delete those data as described [here](./../documentation/flying/settings/reset_screen_size.md).
